freeCodeCamp/common/app/routes/Profile/components/HeatMap.jsx

First Finish the instructions here to begin testing
    CONTRIBUTING.md
    including this tut - https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github



Files in /server/utils
 user-stats.js 
   This is where the streak is compiled

 date-utils.js
    Time between 2 dates is set - timezone is set to be 'UTC' 
      this is one of a few places timezone is set to 'UTC'

      I think this is where if a date follows previous is calculated
    Its Description
       day count between two epochs (inclusive)




 map.js - sets the status of the "map" nav item
 publicUserProps.js - show jSON property for streaks
